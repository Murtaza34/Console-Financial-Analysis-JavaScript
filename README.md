# Console Financial Analysis JavaScript

In this project I have been tasked with creating code for analysing the financial records of a company.

#### Write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The total change in profits from month to month.
- Find the average of change.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
